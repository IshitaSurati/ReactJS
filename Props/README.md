## What are Props?
- Props are like arguments you give to a function.
- In React, you use props to send data from a Parent Component to a Child Component.

This is a simple React project that demonstrates how to pass and use **props** in React. The project showcases how to pass **primitive values**, **objects**, and **arrays** as props from a **Parent Component** to a **Child Component**.

## Features
- **Passing Primitive Props** (String, Number)
- **Passing Object Props**
- **Passing Array Props**
- **Destructuring Props in Child Components**
- **Conditional Rendering for Optional Props**

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

1. **App.js**: The main entry point of the application. It renders the `ParentComponent`.
2. **ParentComponent.js**: A component that passes props (primitive values, objects, and arrays) to the `ChildComponent`.
3. **ChildComponent.js**: A component that receives the props from the parent and displays the data.
